Description: Note that 'imageData' has been superseded by 'growthPheno'. 
    The package 'growthPheno' incorporates all the functionality of 
    'imageData' and has functionality not available in 'imageData', 
    but some 'imageData' functions have been renamed.  
    The 'imageData' package is no longer maintained, but is retained 
    for legacy purposes.
